# cookiecutter-NiklasPyPackage

The way I like my projects to be  ðŸ¤ 

So what are the ingredients of this cookiecutter template?

- pytest, tox
- pre-commit
- flake8, autosort
- template for contributors
- sphinx docs
- makefile to store bash scripts (running tests, clean project etc)
- setup.cfg to configure linting/testing tools
- Description for PyPI generator (repo does not show pics)
- github workflows for testing/codecoverage and deployments (PyPI or Anaconda)

Big parts of this cookiecutter are based on
- [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)
- [template-python](https://github.com/jacebrowning/template-python)
